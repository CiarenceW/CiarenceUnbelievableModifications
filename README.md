# Ciarence's Unbelievable Modifications
### Collection of changes that were too small to release individually
## Features

### TurretAmmoBoxBoom
Want to add a degree of ~~annoyance~~ fun to your regular Receiver 2 gameplay?  
Turrets' ammo boxes now **explode** if you shoot them! (and if they have any ammo left)

### FlashlightTweaks  
Allows you to drop and turn off/on your flashlight on a whim!  
Hold **"E"** with the flashlight in your hands when you're not holding a gun to drop it!   
Press **"X"** by default to toggle the flashlight.

### DropGunEverywhere
Allow you to drop your gun in any scene, anytime.

### GunTweaks
For now, only fixes the main spring on the Desert Eagle, which clips through the grip.

### VictorianFix
For now, only fixes the floor collider on the top floor of the Victorian tile, which would block you from collecting a tape from under the turret that could spawn there.
