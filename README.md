# Ciarence's Unbelievable Modifications
### Collection of changes that were too small to release individually
## Features

### TurretAmmoBoxBoom
Want to add a degree of ~~annoyance~~ fun to your regular Receiver 2 gameplay?  
Turrets' ammo boxes now **explode** if you shoot them! (and if they have any ammo left)

### FlashlightTweaks  
Allows you to drop and turn off/on your flashlight on a whim!  
Hold **"E"** with the flashlight in your hands when you're not holding a gun to drop it!   
Press **"X"** by default to toggle the flashlight.  
You can choose a custom colour for the flashlight!  
Also fixes a bug where the smoke cone's opacity wouldn't lower, even when the flashlight was out of battery.

### PostProcessTweaks
You can now change the colour of the fog :D
Also adds SSR and Motion Blur in the settings menu.

### DropGunEverywhere
Allow you to drop your gun in any scene, anytime.

### lahTweaks
Fixes a bug where the screen would get progressively darker leading eventually to death when making very high jumps repeatedly with GodMode on

### RobotTweaks
Fixes the Bomb Bot so that it doesn't soft-lock the game when it spots the player.  
You can now choose the colours of the lights on the killdrones! Also includes a disco option, inspired by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=welzVVJD4ok) video, by IwanPlays

### GunTweaks
Fixes the main spring on the Desert Eagle, which clips through the grip.
Fixes the magazine catch on the HiPoint C9 to not get stuck in pressed position when insterting magazine.

### RtlgTweaks
Fixes the floor collider on the top floor of the Victorian tile, which would block you from collecting a tape from under the turret that could spawn there.
Fixes base of Two Towers tile to allow bullets to collide with it.

### Config!!!!!!!!!!
You can turn on/off any of these patches anytime you want by going to BepInEx/config/CiarenceUnbelievableModifications.cfg, or by installing one of the many BepInEx [Config](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager) [Managers](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager), which allows you to do it on the fly!
